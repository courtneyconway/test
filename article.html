<p> 
For as gut-wrenching as this week has been in the wake of Sundays deadly mass shooting in Las Vegas, its felt terrifyingly familiar. The same stomach drops, the same tears, the same frustrating fights. Even from the sidelines it feels like a living nightmare, and the closer you get to the nexus, the more horrific things become. I understand the self-preserving urge to close eyes, step away, drown out the noise. I understand wanting to back away from the face-melting rage, the circular arguing, the unavoidable grief and the discomfort bred from wanting to move on but not being able to. If you feel this way, you arent alone. I feel it, too. But as the number of gun deaths in this country grows, it's impossible to not weigh the cost of inaction against that of history repeating itself.
</p>
<p> 

<q> You've become inoculated Congressman Steve Israel wrote in his New York Times oped this morning. You'll read this essay and others like it, and turn the page or click another link. You'll watch or listen to the news and shake your head, then flip to another channel or another app. This horrific event will recede into our collective memory. That's what the gun lobbyists are counting on. They want you to forget. </q>
</p>
<p> 
Many conservative media outlets are saying it's insensitive to use the Vegas shooting as an opportunity to discuss gun control, but the lack of regulation around firearms in this country and the resulting abuse of them are inextricably linked. Failing to draw that connection, explore it and pick it apart when it feels most urgent is a missed opportunity. History bends around inflection points that demand it change course.
</p>
<p> 
<q> If we ever want to live in a better world,</q> wrote Paul Blest for The Outline, <q>it is crucial to immediately highlight why these disasters are political in order to make sure those who die in mass shootings donâ€™t do so in vain.</q>
</p>
<p> 
Every response plays an important role in a disaster's aftermath: that of the President, of congress, of the media, of public figures, of private civilians. Each one is a ripple that makes a wave. Take for instance, the way we report on these events: Do we name the shooter Stephan Paddock a <q>lone wolf,</q> thereby refusing to call this a pattern? Do we humanize him by reporting on what he enjoyed, or do we call him a terrorist, thereby pointing out the racist hypocrisy of our regulatory inaction? Do we call this senseless murder, thereby absolving ourselves from the ominous work of unpacking such an act of violence?
</p>
<p> 
I know the cyclical horror of all this makes it feel like nothing changes, but it does. In the wake of 2016's shooting in Orlando, public push-back made a crack: <q>Several other Republican senators showed some willingness to accept new restrictions on gun purchases if they could be structured in an acceptable way,</q> reported the New York Times. <q> A bipartisan companion measure also was introduced in the House. These are incremental steps, but in the gridlocked world of gun control politics, they count for something.</q>
</p>
<p> 
It's okay if you're new to this; so many of us are. Future generations are depending on us to find a way, endure and do what we can whenever we can. Participation goes a long way, and progress demands it. Below are some ways you can do that today.
